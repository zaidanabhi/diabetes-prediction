# diabetes-prediction

This project was done as a group of five members as a requirement to pass Gunadarma University's Artificial Intelligence class. The result of this project is a model that can predict whether a person has diabetes or not after inputting some numbers that correspond with factors of diabetes, such as heart disease, BMI, and blood glucose level.
